## Install Git LFS (for game sounds to work)!

1. Install Git LFS:
   For macOS:
   ```bash
   brew install git-lfs
   ```
   For Linux:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install git-lfs
2. Initialize Git LFS: In your repository (after cloning), run:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
3. Fetch the actual files. (fetches .wav file):
   ```bash
   git lfs pull

## How to Run the Application

1. Install SDKMAN and Java 22:
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
   sdk install java 22.0.2-amzn

2. Please open a new terminal, or run the following in the existing one, use your username for local username (obviously):

   ```bash
    source "/Users/<local username>/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"

2. If java 22 is not available, you can also check the available versions with:

   ```bash
   sdk list java

3. Make sure you set the default java version and verify:

   ```bash
   sdk default java 22.0.2-amzn
   javac -version
   
4. After cloning the repository, from the `team-1` directory, make the `run.bash` executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x run.bash
5. Start the program by typing:
   ```bash
   ./run.bash

## To simulate traffic between players (For testing purposes only):
Navigate to src/network

1. Compile TrafficGenerator.java:
   ```bash
   javac TrafficGenerator.java
2. Run TrafficGenerator.java:
   ```bash
   java TrafficGenerator.java
3. Your simulation is now ready to receive traffic from the game software!
